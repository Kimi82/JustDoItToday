## Website is available here:

https://justdoittoday-37593.web.app/

Sometimes, you can see blank page, after registration, then please refresh page. I'm currently working on it :)

### WHAT/WHY 
I learn programming on my own at home, I am recording this video to show you the site I am currently working on and, better still, use it to make my life more productive.

Bello you can see how the site looks when we use it for some time (data in chart).

But here is a graph that shows us how productive we were. I calculate the percentage of completed tasks here. It shows things for six days in the past

The site is not finished, of course, I have a lot of new features planned and the refactor of the whole application, because I learned a lot while creating it.

However, I have made it available to the web because as I said, its basic function works and I use it as my tool to create it for lists.
